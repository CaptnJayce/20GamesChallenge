# 20_Games_Challenge

Just some basic information for now 

I will be documenting my attempt at the 20 games Challenge by SDG Games for accountability and a reference for the future (link to the challenge below):

Notes:
- This challenge will be done with C++ and Raylib
- Games will be listed chronologically
- Extra information will be in a designated README.md for each game
- This should include references, resources, some form of a to-do list and extras. 
- Lastly, I won't be working on this every single day (definitely not weekends) and I may "vertically slice" some projects, meaning I'll do a slice of a game that represents its entirety

This is a project for me to learn from and for future me to refer to, there will be lots of mistakes - both embarassing and understandable, as well as a lot of amateur decisions, but that is to be expected and ultimately the point of this challenge.
