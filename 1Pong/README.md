# Game 1: Pong

My pick for Game 1 of the 20GC (20 Games Challenge) is Pong, I don't have any particular reason for picking this specifically - just something simple to get some basics down. 

## To Do:
- ~~Two players with separate controls~~
- ~~Attempt to refactor code into header/implementation files~~
- ~~Refactor code~~
- ~~Add sounds~~
- Allow for user to input desired win condition
- Add CPUPlayer option for player two
- Fix bug for ball getting stuck

## Notes
I know there's some things left to do but I have decided to move onto the next project as this I want to explore further concepts.
