# Game 2: Jetpack Joyride

I chose Jetpack Joyride because I want to tackle the infinite object generation (coins, obstacles, textures), as well as making my own sprites. 

## To Do:
- ~~Generate floors and ceilings infinitely~~
- ~~Generate coins infinitely~~
- ~~Main menu~~
- ~~Pause menu~~ 
- Restart menu
- Track high scores (coin & distance)
- Sprites for player, floor/roof, background, coins, obstacles.
- Five different coin patters
- Refactoring
- Testing
